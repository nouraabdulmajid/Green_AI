# A Review of Software Engineering Frameworks and Libraries for Green AI

Within this repository is a literature review I conducted in order to identify the most eco-friendly, or 'Green', Artificial Intelligence (AI) Frameworks and Libraries. 

### Topic selection
I chose the topic of the literature review, although the assignment was set by a university: the task had been to write a literature review on any software engineering topic. 

Doing background reading allowed me to narrow the focus of the report to the use of libraries and frameworks for Green AI. Writing the review provided some interesting insights about Green AI, which are evident in the 'Critical Evaluation' section of the report. 

### Overview of findings

* There is no one library or framework that is 'greener' than another across the board. Which library or framework is more 'green' depends on a variety of factors, such as whether it is being used for training or inference of a machine learning model, and on the type of model. 

* Some of the frameworks and libraries that were considered included TensorFlow, PyTorch, and GPU and CPU acceleration libraries. 

* The majority of the relevant literature focussed on deep learning models.
  
* There is a shortage of literature containing measurements of the energy-efficiency of AI libraries and frameworks across different configurations or in different situations. Conducting more research in this field is crucial in order to guide the selection of the most energy-efficient libraries and frameworks in specific situations.
  
* As there are frequent developments in technology which result in new hardware and software for AI, such as new GPUs, such literature must also be updated frequently.
