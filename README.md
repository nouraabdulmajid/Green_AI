# A Review of Software Engineering Frameworks and Libraries for Green AI

Within this repository is a literature review I conducted in order to identify the most eco-friendly, or 'Green', Artificial Intelligence (AI) Frameworks and Libraries. 

The topic of the literature review was chosen by myself, although the assignment was set by a university: the task had been to write a literature review on any software engineering topic.

Writing the review provided some interesting insights about Green AI, which are evident in the 'Critical Evaluation' section of the report. 

A general overview of the findings: 

* There is no one library or framework that is 'greener' than another across the board. Which library or framework is more 'green' depends on a variety of factors, such as whether it is being used for training or inference of a machine learning model, and on the type of model. 

* Some of the frameworks and libraries that were considered included TensorFlow, PyTorch, and GPU and CPU acceleration libraries. 

* The majority of the relevant literature focussed on deep learning models.
